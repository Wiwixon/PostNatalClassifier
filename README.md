# Web Application for Collecting Data and Classifying the Risk of Postpartum Depression

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop, implement, and evaluate a web system for the early detection of postpartum depression. The system collects and analyzes data on risk factors, leveraging machine learning algorithms to classify the risk and facilitate timely intervention. It aims to promote personalized support, education, awareness, access to professional help, and scientific research.

## Objectives and Scope
- **Early Detection:** Collect data on risk factors to identify postpartum depression early.
- **Personalized Support:** Provide tailored actions and support to individuals at risk.
- **Education and Awareness:** Promote understanding and awareness of postpartum depression.
- **Professional Help:** Facilitate access to mental health professionals.
- **Scientific Research:** Enable ongoing research and progress monitoring to improve detection and treatment.

## Results
- **Data Preparation:** Handling missing data, processing categorical data, and dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation and optimization of Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms.
- **Data Visualization:** Use of plots and diagrams to visualize data and results.
- **Web System:** Development of a web application using the XGBoost classifier with components such as the user interface, backend, classification model, and database.

## Main Features
- **User Interface:** Allows data entry and visualization of classification results.
- **Backend Server:** Manages requests and communication between the frontend and the classification model.
- **Classification Model:** Utilizes the XGBoost algorithm to predict the risk of postpartum depression.
- **Database:** Stores collected data securely.

## Future Work
- **Function Expansion:** Enhance application functions and user experience.
- **Data Security:** Implement robust data security mechanisms.
- **Database Expansion:** Increase the scope and scale of the database.
- **Research:** Study the system's effectiveness across different populations.
